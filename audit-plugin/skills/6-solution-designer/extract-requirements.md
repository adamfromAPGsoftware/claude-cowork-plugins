# Extract Requirements (RE)

> **Idempotent.** First run creates requirements from scratch. Re-runs update based on proposed change updates.

> **INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION ONLY.** Requirements specifications are never shown to clients. They are for the dev team and project management.

## Purpose

For each proposed change (grouped by transformation blueprint phase), decompose into functional requirements with user stories, acceptance criteria, screen inventory, data model, user roles, and integration specs. Write the `requirements_spec` top-level object to audit-data.json.

---

## Stage 1: Pre-flight

1. Check audit data is loaded and `proposed_changes[]` has implementation + value populated.

2. Scan for readiness:
   ```
   REQUIREMENTS STATUS — {company_name}
   Proposed changes: {n} total ({n} with implementation + value)
   Transformation blueprint: {present|absent} ({n} phases)
   Existing requirements_spec: {present|absent}
   ```

3. If `proposed_changes[]` lack implementation or value, warn and suggest running Improvement Researcher [BR] first.

4. Select scope:
   ```
   Select scope for requirements extraction:
     A) All changes — {n} changes across {n} phases
     B) Specific phase (e.g., Phase 1: Quick Wins)
     C) Specific change by ID (e.g., CH-001)
     D) All changes in sequence
   ```

---

## Stage 2: Functional Requirements Decomposition

For each selected change within the chosen packages, decompose into functional requirements.

### 2a. Extract user stories

From the change's `modal_content`, `proposed_solution`, and `affected_step_ids`, derive user stories:

```
As a {role}, I want to {action} so that {outcome}.
```

- Role comes from the step owner or `staff_roster[]` match
- Action comes from the proposed solution
- Outcome comes from the value calculation (time saved or productivity gained)

Each change should produce 1-3 user stories depending on complexity.

### 2b. Write acceptance criteria

For each user story, write testable acceptance criteria:

```
Given {precondition}
When {action}
Then {expected result}
```

Draw from:
- Current step descriptions (what must change)
- Proposed tools (what integrations must work)
- Value assumptions (what must be true for the value calculation to hold)

### 2c. Populate requirements array

```json
{
  "requirement_id": "REQ-001",
  "change_id": "CH-001",
  "package_id": "PKG-001",
  "title": "Automated lead follow-up sequence",
  "user_stories": [
    {
      "story_id": "US-001",
      "role": "Sales Manager",
      "action": "have new leads automatically entered into a nurture sequence",
      "outcome": "I don't spend 3.5 hrs/wk manually sending follow-up emails",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        {
          "given": "a new lead is created in HubSpot",
          "when": "the lead matches the target segment criteria",
          "then": "the lead is automatically enrolled in the appropriate nurture sequence within 5 minutes"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "priority": "must-have",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "notes": ""
}
```

---

## Stage 3: Identify User Roles

Build the user roles inventory from two sources:

### 3a. From staff_roster

Extract roles from `staff_roster[]` that appear as step owners in affected processes:
```json
{
  "role_id": "ROLE-001",
  "name": "Sales Manager",
  "source": "staff_roster",
  "staff_members": ["{STAFF_NAME}"],
  "affected_packages": ["PKG-001"],
  "permission_level": "admin",
  "notes": "Primary user of HubSpot CRM"
}
```

### 3b. From end-user types

Identify external user types from process context (e.g., clients, leads, suppliers):
```json
{
  "role_id": "ROLE-005",
  "name": "Client",
  "source": "end_user",
  "staff_members": [],
  "affected_packages": ["PKG-001", "PKG-002"],
  "permission_level": "external",
  "notes": "Receives automated communications and self-service portal access"
}
```

---

## Stage 4: Build Screen Inventory

For each requirement that involves a user interface, identify the screens needed.

### 4a. Identify screen types

- **Configuration screens** — setup and settings for automations
- **Dashboard screens** — monitoring and reporting views
- **Input screens** — forms, data entry points
- **Notification screens** — alerts, email templates, SMS templates
- **Integration screens** — connection setup, mapping configuration

### 4b. Populate screen inventory

```json
{
  "screen_id": "SCR-001",
  "name": "Lead Nurture Sequence Configuration",
  "type": "configuration",
  "package_id": "PKG-001",
  "requirement_ids": ["REQ-001"],
  "platform": "HubSpot",
  "description": "Configure nurture sequence triggers, email templates, and timing rules",
  "user_roles": ["ROLE-001"],
  "is_custom_build": false,
  "notes": "Native HubSpot sequences UI — no custom build needed"
}
```

Mark `is_custom_build: true` for screens that need custom development vs. native platform UI.

---

## Stage 5: Build Data Model

Identify the key data entities from the requirements and their relationships.

### 5a. Extract entities

From user stories and acceptance criteria, identify data entities:
```json
{
  "entity_id": "ENT-001",
  "name": "Lead",
  "source_system": "HubSpot",
  "key_fields": ["name", "email", "company", "segment", "source", "created_date"],
  "relationships": [
    { "target_entity": "ENT-002", "type": "has_many", "description": "Lead has many Activities" }
  ],
  "package_ids": ["PKG-001"],
  "notes": "Existing HubSpot contact object — may need custom properties added"
}
```

### 5b. Map data flows

For each integration point, document the data flow:
```json
{
  "flow_id": "FLOW-001",
  "name": "New Lead to Nurture Sequence",
  "source_entity": "ENT-001",
  "source_system": "HubSpot",
  "destination_system": "HubSpot Sequences",
  "trigger": "Lead created with segment = target",
  "fields_mapped": ["name", "email", "segment"],
  "frequency": "real-time",
  "package_id": "PKG-001"
}
```

---

## Stage 6: Map Integration Requirements

From `proposed_tools[]` on each change and `research.tools_researched[]`, document integration specs.

### 6a. Extract integrations

```json
{
  "integration_id": "INT-001",
  "name": "HubSpot to Xero Sync",
  "source_system": "HubSpot",
  "target_system": "Xero",
  "integration_method": "API",
  "middleware": "Make.com",
  "package_id": "PKG-001",
  "api_details": {
    "source_api": "HubSpot CRM API v3",
    "target_api": "Xero Accounting API 2.0",
    "auth_method": "OAuth 2.0",
    "rate_limits": "100 requests/10 seconds (HubSpot), 60/minute (Xero)"
  },
  "data_entities": ["ENT-001", "ENT-003"],
  "requirements": ["REQ-001", "REQ-004"],
  "risks": ["API rate limits may require batching for bulk operations"],
  "notes": "Research confirmed API endpoints exist for all required operations"
}
```

### 6b. Cross-reference with research

Pull from `research.tools_researched[]` on each proposed change:
- API documentation links
- Known limitations
- Pricing implications (e.g., API access requires higher plan tier)
- Authentication requirements

---

## Stage 7: Write Requirements Spec to Audit Data

Write the `requirements_spec` top-level object to audit-data.json:

```json

  "requirements_spec": {

## Stage 9: Save

1. Write `requirements_spec` top-level object to audit data
2. Update `architect_metadata`:
   ```json
   {
     "architect_metadata": {
       "last_re_run": "ISO timestamp",
       "total_re_runs": 1,
       "requirements_extracted": 12,
