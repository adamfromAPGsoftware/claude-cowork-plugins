# Audit Completeness Checklist

Used by the Analyst agent to track coverage per stage. A stage is `covered: true` only when the consultant confirms it — not when items are inferred.

## Per-Stage Checklist

Apply this checklist to **each stage** discovered in `processes[]`. Stages are dynamic — derived from transcript analysis, not a fixed list. Common examples: Acquisition, Quoting, Onboarding, Fulfilment, Retention, Property Management, Recruitment, etc.

### For every stage:
- [ ] Core process steps described end-to-end (complete workflow, not just highlights)
- [ ] Staff roles involved named (who does what)
- [ ] Tools used in this stage named (software, platforms, manual methods)
- [ ] Time spent per unit of work stated (hours/week, hours/task, hours/client)
- [ ] Volume/frequency stated (per week, per month, per year)
- [ ] Pain points identified (or confirmed none exist)
- [ ] Handoff to/from other stages described (who triggers, how data moves)
- [ ] Exception handling described (what happens when things go wrong)

## Coverage Rating Guide

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **HIGH confidence** | Multiple explicit statements with specifics — times, volumes, names |
| **MEDIUM confidence** | Process described but key data (times, volumes) not stated |
| **LOW confidence** | Stage mentioned but not described — needs follow-up |
| **Not covered** | No mention at all — must be on follow-up agenda |

## Waste Quantification Checklist

Used by the GQ (Generate Questions) capability to audit waste item readiness. A waste item is "quantified" only when all required fields are populated with real (not estimated) data.

### Per waste_item (time-based — standard model)
- [ ] `hours_per_week` populated (null = hard gap)
- [ ] `headcount_affected` populated (null = gap; 1 acceptable if single person stated)
- [ ] `hourly_rate_aud` populated with `rate_is_estimated = false` (estimated = soft gap)
- [ ] `annual_waste_aud` calculable: hrs/wk × headcount × rate × 52
- [ ] `confidence` is HIGH or MEDIUM (LOW items don't appear on waste.html)

### Per waste_item (revenue leakage — hours_per_week N/A by design)
- [ ] Volume metric stated (occurrences per year, lost leads per month, families affected, etc.)
- [ ] Per-unit value stated (avg plan value, avg customer lifetime value, avg job value, etc.)
- [ ] Miss/loss rate stated (% missed, % churned, % paying cash directly, etc.)
- [ ] `annual_waste_aud` calculated from volume × value × rate

### Staff rate readiness
- [ ] `blended_hourly_rate_aud` derived from actual salary data (not $50 fallback)
- [ ] `blended_rate_confidence` = HIGH
- [ ] Each `staff_roster[]` entry has `hourly_rate` populated
- [ ] Waste items using `rate_is_estimated: true` count as soft gaps

### Volume multipliers
- [ ] New clients/families per week stated (unlocks per-onboard waste items)
- [ ] New staff/workers onboarded per week stated (unlocks per-onboard waste items)
- [ ] Active client count stated (unlocks revenue leakage calculations)
- [ ] Lead volume per month stated (unlocks conversion/nurture waste items)
