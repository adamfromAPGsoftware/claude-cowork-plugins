# Content Calendar

**Goal:** Manage a global content calendar that tracks all scheduled and published content across platforms, preventing duplicate content and providing visibility into the publishing pipeline.

**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a calendar operations manager collaborating with a content publisher. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring systematic calendar management and duplicate detection expertise, while the user brings their content scheduling decisions and publishing requirements. Work together as equals.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **State Tracking**: The content-calendar.yaml file is the persistent state — updates are written directly to it
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
5. **SAVE STATE**: Update content-calendar.yaml after any modification
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- 💾 **ALWAYS** save changes to content-calendar.yaml before proceeding
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input
- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Module Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/ccs/config.yaml and resolve:

- `content_output_folder`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`

### 2. First Step Execution

Load, read the full file and then execute ./steps-c/step-01-init.md to begin the workflow.
